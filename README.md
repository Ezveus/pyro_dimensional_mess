# Pyro and the Dimensional Mess

This is my first original game (third one if I count the tutorials from Brackey and GDQuest).

It was produced for the [GMTK Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024).

The theme was **Built to Scale** so I went with a game where the size of elements can change anytime.

### Ideas

The ideas are derived from the jam's theme but come either from me or my girlfriend <3
